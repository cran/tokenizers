### Installation

You can install this package from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("tokenizers")
```

To get the development version from GitHub, use [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/tokenizers")
```

### Examples

The tokenizers in this package have a consistent interface. They all take either a character vector of any length, or a list where each element is a character vector of length one. The idea is that each element comprises a text. Then each function returns a list with the same length as the input vector, where each element in the list contains the tokens generated by the function. If the input character vector or list is named, then the names are preserved, so that the names can serve as identifiers.

``` r
library(magrittr)
library(tokenizers)
